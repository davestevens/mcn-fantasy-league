-- MCN Fantasy League Team Picker
-- http://mcn.fantasyleague.com/
-- Constraints:
--  - 2 Riders from each class (MotoGP, WSB, BSB)
--  - Total Team cost Â£10 million
-- NB:
--  - Each class has a different number of races per round

-- -- Filter Riders with zero points

-- -- Return all pairs of Riders

-- -- Return total cost of Team
