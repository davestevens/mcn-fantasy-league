-- MCN Fantasy League Team Picker
-- http://mcn.fantasyleague.com/
-- Constraints:
--  - 2 Riders from each class (MotoGP, WSB, BSB)
--  - Total Team cost Â£10 million
-- NB:
--  - Each class has a different number of races per round

module Main where
import System.IO

-- Create lists of all Riders
import MotoGP
import WSB
import BSB

-- Extact data from Rider tuple
getName (name,_,_) = name
getPrice (_,price,_) = price
getPoints (_,_,points) = points

-- -- Return a new tuple with potential points
calculate_potential_points rider completed in_round =
  (getName(rider), getPrice(rider), (getPoints(rider) `div` completed) * in_round)
-- -- Map over passed Riders
calculate_potential_points' riders completed in_round =
  map (\rider -> calculate_potential_points rider completed in_round)  riders

-- -- Return all pairs of Riders
get_pair riders = [ [x, y] | x <- riders, y <- riders, x /= y]

main = do
  -- Calculate each Riders potential points (based on current points, races completed & races in round)
  let motogp = calculate_potential_points' MotoGP.riders MotoGP.races_completed MotoGP.races_in_round
  let wsb = calculate_potential_points' WSB.riders WSB.races_completed WSB.races_in_round
  let bsb = calculate_potential_points' BSB.riders BSB.races_completed BSB.races_in_round

  -- Pick 2 Riders from each class
  let motogp_riders = get_pair motogp
  let wsb_riders = get_pair wsb
  let bsb_riders = get_pair bsb

  -- Iterate over each set of two riders from each class
  -- Filter to only valid team selections
  -- Order by potential points
